## Overview
The UFC Fight Club App allows users to search their favorite fighter, find an event, learn the history of the UFC, take a trivia quiz, or find the latest news.

## How does it work?

### Page 1
Page 1 allows the user to search for a fighter by name or an event by city name. To find a fighter, type the first and last name of your favorite fighter. A headshot of that fighter, along with a list of information about them will populate below, as well as ten GIF's related to the fighter searched. To find an event, simply type a city name and if there is an event it will appear in a pop up window that can take the user to the event on the Ticket Master website.

### Page 2
Page 2 allows the user to learn the history of the UFC, as well as learn some interesting facts, and take a trivia quiz. To scroll through the history, simply click the left or right arrows to move to the next slide, this also applies to the Facts carousel. The quiz can be initiated by clicking the Start button and answering the questions in the time alloted. At the end, the program will display the score and tell the user how well they did. 

### Page 3
Page 3 is the News Page. It is automatically populated with the most recent UFC news. The user can click an article and the link will take them to the relevant page to show the article or video. The user can also save articles for future reading.
